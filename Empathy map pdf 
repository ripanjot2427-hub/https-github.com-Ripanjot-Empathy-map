Introduction
The Classical Empathy Map is a widely used design-thinking tool 
developed by Dave Gray (founder of XPLANE). It helps organizations, 
designers, marketers, and product developers better understand their 
customers or target audience. It is called ‘classical’ because it refers to 
the original 4-quadrant version of the empathy map, which has been 
foundational in customer-centric strategy building.
At its core, the empathy map is about visualizing what a customer thinks, 
feels, says, and does in a given situation. Unlike market research data 
that only focuses on demographics or behaviour, the empathy map 
emphasizes the psychological and emotional dimensions of users. By 
doing so, it helps bridge the gap between the product/service and real 
human needs. 
Structure of the Classical Empathy Map
The classical empathy map is usually represented as a canvas divided 
into four quadrants surrounding a sketch or symbol of the ‘user/customer.’ 
Each quadrant answers a specific question about the user’s experiences:
1. Says – What does the user explicitly say in interviews, 
conversations, or feedback?
2. Thinks – What occupies the user’s thoughts and concerns, even if 
they don’t verbalize it?
3. Does – What actions and behaviours does the user perform in real 
situations?
4. Feels – What emotions drive or hinder the user in the given context?
 This four-part model captures both external expressions (says/does) 
and internal states (thinks/feels), creating a holistic view of the 
customer.
Components of the Classical Empathy Map
a) Says
- This quadrant records direct quotes or statements from the user.
- Example: A customer might say, “This app is too complicated to set up,” 
or “I love how fast the delivery is.”
- Data sources: interviews, surveys, customer support interactions, 
testimonials.
- b) Thinks
- Focuses on the unspoken thoughts, beliefs, and assumptions a customer 
has.
- These are harder to capture but can be inferred from patterns in 
behaviour and context.
- Example: A user may think, “I don’t trust online payment fully,” even if 
they don’t say it aloud.
- Data sources: behavioural studies, observation, contextual inquiry.
c) Does
- Reflects the actual actions and behaviours of the user in real life.
- Example: Browsing a website multiple times before making a purchase, 
abandoning carts, or checking reviews before buying.
-d) Feels
- Focuses on the emotional state of the user—both positive and negative.
- Example: A user might feel frustrated with a slow app, anxious about 
delivery delays, or delighted when customer service is responsive.
- Data sources: tone of voice in conversations, body language in 
observations, emotional response studies.
Purpose of the Classical Empathy Map
- User-Centric Understanding: Moves beyond demographics to 
understand psychological and emotional drivers.
- Identify Pain Points: Reveals frustrations, barriers, and unmet 
needs.
- Highlight Motivations: Shows what excites and motivates 
users.
- Improve Products/Services: Guides teams to align solutions 
with real user needs.
- Enhance Communication: Provides a shared visualization that 
teams can collaboratively build upon.
Applications of the Classical Empathy Map
- Product Design: Helps UX/UI designers create intuitive 
interfaces.
- Marketing: Enables marketers to craft messages that resonate 
emotionally.
- Customer Experience (CX): Improves service design and 
customer journey mapping.
- Innovation Workshops: Used in brainstorming sessions to 
generate user-centered ideas.
- Business Strategy: Aligns leadership decisions with customer 
expectations.
Example
Suppose you are mapping the experience of an online food delivery app 
user:
- Says: “The app is easy to use, but delivery takes too long.”
- Thinks: “Maybe I should try another app with better ratings.”
- Does: Frequently checks delivery time, compares prices with 
competitors, leaves reviews.
- Feels: Excited when food is discounted, frustrated when 
orders are late.
This map can guide the business to reduce delivery time, improve tracking 
features, and launch loyalty rewards, directly addressing user needs.
